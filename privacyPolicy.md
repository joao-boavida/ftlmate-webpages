## Privacy Policy for FTLmate

v1.0 August 18, 2024

### Introduction

FTLmate ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use that information, and the steps we take to ensure your information is protected.

### 1. Information We Collect

The App does not collect any personal data from users. The only information collected relates to purchase history, which is managed anonymously.

**Purchase History:**

The App uses RevenueCat, a third-party service, to manage purchases. RevenueCat collects and stores purchase history data, but this information is not linked to any personal identifiers. User IDs generated for purchase purposes are anonymous, and we have no access to any personal information through these transactions.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

Since the App does not collect any personal data, the primary use of the information we handle (purchase history) is to manage and verify in-app purchases. This ensures that users have access to the features and services they have paid for.

### 3. Data Sharing and Storage

- **Data Sharing:** We do not share any user data with third parties. The only data managed is purchase history, handled securely through RevenueCat, which does not link purchases to personally identifiable information.
- **Data Storage:** RevenueCat handles all purchase history data. The App itself does not store any user data.

### 4. User Rights

Given that no personal data is collected or stored, there are no personal data rights applicable to users of FTLmate. If you have concerns regarding your purchase history or transactions, please refer to RevenueCat's privacy policy or contact us directly.

### 5. Compliance

FTLmate complies with applicable privacy regulations and ensures that all collected data (purchase history) is handled securely and anonymously.

### 6. Third-Party Services

FTLmate uses RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases. For more information on how RevenueCat handles data, please review their [Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

### 7. Children's Privacy

FTLmate is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect any data from children. If you believe that a child has made a purchase in the App without parental consent, please contact us immediately.

### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. Users are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of any updates.
